Sarcopenia and Sarcopenic Obesity: Data Integration and Analysis Resources

This repository contains curated resources and databases related to sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and their genetic, proteomic, and phytochemical associations. The datasets and tools included here facilitate research into the molecular mechanisms, therapeutic targets, and disease associations underlying muscle loss, obesity, and age-related metabolic conditions.

Background

Sarcopenia is the age-associated progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength, leading to reduced physical function and metabolic health. Lean muscle mass can account for up to 50% of body weight in young adults but declines to ~25% by age 80. Annual muscle mass loss after age 50 is typically 1–2%, with strength declining even faster. Mechanistically, sarcopenia involves:

Atrophy of type II muscle fibers

Reduced satellite cell numbers, impairing regeneration

Sarcopenic obesity refers to the coexistence of sarcopenia and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). Both conditions share inflammatory pathways, with sarcopenia reducing physical activity and energy expenditure, increasing the risk of obesity.
