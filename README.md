# Sarcopenia and Sarcopenic Obesity: Data Integration and Analysis Resources

This repository contains curated resources and databases related to **sarcopenia**, **sarcopenic obesity**, and their genetic, proteomic, and phytochemical associations. The datasets and tools included facilitate research into molecular mechanisms, therapeutic targets, and disease associations underlying muscle loss, obesity, and age-related metabolic conditions.

## Background

**Sarcopenia** is the age-associated progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength, leading to reduced physical function and metabolic health. Key facts:

- Lean muscle mass contributes up to 50% of body weight in young adults, declining to ~25% by age 80.
- After age 50, annual muscle mass loss is 1–2%, with strength decreasing faster.
- Mechanisms include atrophy of type II muscle fibers and reduced satellite cells for regeneration.

**Sarcopenic obesity** is the coexistence of sarcopenia and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). It shares inflammatory pathways, where sarcopenia reduces physical activity and energy expenditure, increasing obesity risk.
